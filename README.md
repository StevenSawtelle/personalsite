A Jekyll implementation of the [Stylish Portfolio](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/stylish-portfolio/) template by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).

Built to showcase my personal interests, what makes me cool, and my projects as I start to work on them.

## If you would like to use a similar template to what I based this off of, check this out!

- Start by adding your info in `_config.yml`
- Add as many address lines as you want. Your address will also be used to show your location on the map.
- For the emdeded map to work you'll need to [get a key from Google Maps Embed API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/?hl=en)
- In `_layouts/front.html` reorder or remove section as you prefer.
